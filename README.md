# Claymation addon for blender

Utilities to create and use per frame Shape Keys.

This addon gives you ability to do a "Sculpt Animation" with a few handy tools located in object data panel in the Properties Area
The addon is wip/unstable.

Don't hesitate to report and test, but for real claymation project, you may consider using  
https://github.com/aldrinsartfactory/stopmagic  
which seems more mature (didn't test it myself yet).
